# Multiprocessing vs Multithreading vs Multiprogramming

## 1. Multiprogramming
**Multiprogramming** is a technique where multiple programs reside in memory and the CPU switches between them to improve resource utilization. It ensures that the CPU is always working by switching to another program when one is waiting for I/O.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Increases CPU utilization by keeping multiple programs in memory.
- Only **one program executes at a time**, while others wait.
- The OS schedules processes efficiently to avoid CPU idle time.

### **Example:**
- A user is running a **web browser, text editor, and a music player** at the same time. While the browser is waiting for a page to load, the CPU executes instructions from the text editor.

## 2. Multithreading
**Multithreading** allows multiple threads to run within the same process. Each thread shares the same memory and resources but operates independently.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Multiple threads within the **same process** share memory.
- Efficient because context switching between threads is **faster** than between processes.
- Useful for parallel execution of tasks within an application.

### **Example:**
- A web browser has:
  - One thread handling **user input (clicks, typing).**
  - Another thread **loading a webpage**.
  - A separate thread **playing a video**.

## 3. Multiprocessing
**Multiprocessing** refers to using **multiple CPUs** (or cores) to execute multiple processes in parallel.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Uses **multiple processors or CPU cores** for execution.
- Each process runs **independently** with its own memory space.
- Increases system performance and allows true parallel execution.

### **Example:**
- A **modern gaming PC** runs multiple processes like:
  - Game rendering on one CPU core.
  - Physics calculations on another core.
  - AI processing on a separate core.

## 4. Key Differences

| Feature            | Multiprogramming | Multithreading | Multiprocessing |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Execution Type** | Multiple programs, but only one executes at a time | Multiple threads within a single process | Multiple processes running on multiple CPUs |
| **Resource Sharing** | Programs have separate memory | Threads share memory within a process | Processes have separate memory |
| **Context Switching** | Between processes | Between threads (faster) | Between processes (slower) |
| **Parallelism** | No true parallel execution | Parallel execution within a process | True parallel execution across CPUs |
| **Example** | Running multiple applications (Chrome, VSCode, Music Player) | A browser with separate threads for rendering, downloading, and UI | Running a game with different CPU cores handling AI, rendering, and physics |

## 5. Real-World Analogy

- **Multiprogramming** → A single chef **cooking multiple dishes** but one at a time.
- **Multithreading** → A chef **chopping vegetables, boiling water, and frying food** simultaneously.
- **Multiprocessing** → A **kitchen with multiple chefs**, each cooking different dishes at the same time.

## 6. Summary
- **Multiprogramming** keeps the CPU busy by switching between programs.
- **Multithreading** allows multiple threads to run within a single process.
- **Multiprocessing** utilizes multiple processors for executing multiple processes in parallel.
