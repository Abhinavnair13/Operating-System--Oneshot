# Deadlock in Operating Systems

## 1. What is Deadlock?
A **deadlock** is a situation where two or more processes are **waiting indefinitely** for resources that are held by each other. This results in a cycle of dependencies where no process can proceed.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Processes remain in a **waiting state** indefinitely.
- Resources are **not released**, causing a system halt.
- Occurs in **multiprocessing** and **multithreading** environments.

## 2. Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
Deadlock occurs when all **four** of the following conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** – A resource can only be held by one process at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait** – A process holding a resource can request additional resources while keeping the ones it has.
3. **No Preemption** – Resources cannot be forcibly taken away; they must be released voluntarily by the holding process.
4. **Circular Wait** – A set of processes form a cycle where each process waits for a resource held by the next process in the cycle.

If **any one** of these conditions is **prevented or broken**, deadlock cannot occur.

## 3. Deadlock Example
A real-world analogy is **two cars at a narrow bridge**:
- Each car needs to cross but neither can proceed because they are blocking each other.
- Unless one car **backs up (releases a resource)**, both will remain stuck.

## Summary
- **Deadlock** occurs when processes wait indefinitely for each other’s resources.
- It requires **mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait**.
- It can be **prevented, avoided, detected, and recovered**.
- Methods like **Banker’s Algorithm** help in deadlock avoidance.

Understanding deadlock is essential for designing **efficient, concurrent, and deadlock-free systems**.
