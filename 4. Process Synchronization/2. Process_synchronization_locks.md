# Process synchronization locks

## 1. Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock)
A **Mutex** is a binary lock that ensures only **one thread or process** can access a shared resource at a time.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Only **one process/thread** can hold the mutex at a time.
- If a process tries to acquire a locked mutex, it gets **blocked**.
- When the process **releases the mutex**, another waiting process can acquire it.

### **Example Usage (C - Pthreads)**
```c
pthread_mutex_t lock;

pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);  // Acquire the lock
// Critical Section
pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock); // Release the lock
```

### Real-World Analogy:
-  A toilet with a single key

- If someone is inside (holding the key), others must wait.
When they leave, they give the key to the next person.

## 2. Semaphore
A **Semaphore** is a synchronization tool that allows multiple processes or threads to access a limited number of resources.

### **Types of Semaphores:**
1. **Binary Semaphore (Mutex-like)**: Only 0 or 1, allowing only one process to access the critical section.
2. **Counting Semaphore**: Allows a fixed number of processes to access the critical section.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Uses two operations:
  - `wait()` (also called `P()` or `down()`) – Decreases the semaphore value (blocks if value is 0).
  - `signal()` (also called `V()` or `up()`) – Increases the semaphore value (wakes up a waiting process).

### Example Usage (C - Semaphores)
```c
#include <semaphore.h>

sem_t S;

sem_init(&S, 0, 1);  // Initialize semaphore with value 1

sem_wait(&S);   // Decrease value (enter critical section)
// Critical Section
sem_post(&S);   // Increase value (exit critical section)
```
### **Real-World Analogy**
A **parking lot with limited spaces**:
- If a car arrives and a spot is available, it parks (decreases the semaphore count).
- When a car leaves, a spot becomes free (increases the semaphore count).
- If no spots are available, new cars must wait.

## 3. Read-Write Locks
A **Read-Write Lock (RW Lock)** allows multiple readers to access a resource simultaneously but ensures that only **one writer** can access it at a time.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Multiple Readers Allowed**: Multiple threads can read at the same time.
- **Exclusive Writers**: A writer gets exclusive access.
- **Prevents Starvation**: Ensures neither readers nor writers are permanently blocked.
 ### Example Usage (C - Pthreads RW Locks)
  ```c
  pthread_rwlock_t lock;

  pthread_rwlock_rdlock(&lock); // Acquire read lock
  // Reading section
  pthread_rwlock_unlock(&lock); // Release read lock

  pthread_rwlock_wrlock(&lock); // Acquire write lock
  // Writing section
  pthread_rwlock_unlock(&lock); // Release write lock

  ```
  ### **Real-World Analogy**
  A **library reading room**:
  - Many people can **read books** at the same time.
  - But when **one person wants to write or update** a book, they must have exclusive access.

  ## Key Differences

  | Feature        | Mutex | Semaphore | Read-Write Lock |
  |---------------|-------|-----------|----------------|
  | **Access**    | Only one thread/process at a time | Can allow multiple accesses (counting) | Multiple readers or a single writer |
  | **Blocking**  | Blocks other processes until released | Allows multiple processes based on value | Blocks writers if readers are present |
  | **Usage**     | Ensures mutual exclusion | Controls access to limited resources | Optimized for read-heavy workloads |
  | **Example**   | Single-user toilet | Parking lot with limited spots | Library reading room |

  ---

## Summary
  - **Mutex**: Ensures **one process/thread at a time**.
  - **Semaphore**: Can allow **multiple accesses** but controls resource limits.
  - **Read-Write Locks**: Allow **multiple readers** or **one writer**.
