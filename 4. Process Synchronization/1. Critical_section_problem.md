# Critical Section Problem in Operating Systems

## 1. What is the Critical Section Problem?
The **Critical Section Problem** occurs in **concurrent programming** when multiple processes or threads access shared resources (such as memory, files, or variables) simultaneously, leading to inconsistencies and race conditions.

### **Key Concept:**
- The **Critical Section** is a part of a program where shared resources are accessed.
- **Race Conditions** occur when multiple processes modify shared data at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.
- The OS must ensure **mutual exclusion** so that only one process executes in the critical section at a time.

## 2. Example of the Problem
### **Example: Bank Account Transaction**
- Suppose **two processes** (P1 and P2) are trying to update the same **bank balance**.
- **P1 reads the balance: $1000**.
- **P2 also reads the balance: $1000**.
- **P1 adds $500** and saves **$1500**.
- **P2 withdraws $200** but was still using the original balance of $1000, so it saves **$800**.
- Final balance should be **$1300**, but due to race conditions, it becomes **$800**.

This happens because both processes accessed and modified the balance **without synchronization**.

## 3. Conditions for a Solution
A correct solution to the **Critical Section Problem** must satisfy three conditions:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can execute in the critical section at a time.
2. **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section, other waiting processes should be able to enter.
3. **Bounded Waiting**: A process should not wait indefinitely to enter the critical section.

## 4. Solutions to the Critical Section Problem

### **Software-Based Solutions**
#### **Peterson’s Algorithm**
- Works for **two processes**.
- Uses two variables (`flag[]` and `turn`) to ensure **mutual exclusion**.

#### **Dekker’s Algorithm**
- Oldest software solution for two processes.
- Uses turn-based execution to avoid conflicts.
