# Multi-Level Queue Scheduling

## What is Multi-Level Queue Scheduling?
Multi-level queue scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm where processes are divided into separate queues based on their type or priority. Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm, and the OS decides how much CPU time each queue gets. This helps manage different kinds of tasks efficiently.

## How it Works
- **Process Grouping**: Processes are grouped into queues (e.g., system processes, interactive processes, batch processes).
- **Queue Priority**: Higher-priority queues get CPU access before lower-priority ones.
- **Scheduling Within Queues**: Each queue uses its own algorithm (e.g., Round Robin for interactive, FCFS for batch).
- **Time Allocation**: The OS assigns a fixed portion of CPU time to each queue. If a higher-priority queue is empty, lower-priority queues get a chance.
- **Example Flow**: A system process (high priority) runs first, then an interactive app (medium priority), and finally a background task (low priority).

## Real-World Example
Imagine a restaurant with three types of customers:
- **VIPs (High Priority Queue)**: Served immediately using FCFS.
- **Regular Customers (Medium Priority Queue)**: Served in a Round Robin style with a 5-minute limit per person.
- **Takeout Orders (Low Priority Queue)**: Processed in FCFS when VIPs and regulars are done.
The manager ensures VIPs get priority, then regulars, and takeout last.

## Pros
- **Organized Task Management**: Different types of processes (e.g., real-time, interactive, batch) are handled separately.
- **Prioritization**: Critical tasks (like system processes) get CPU time first.
- **Efficient for Mixed Workloads**: Works well when the system runs a variety of tasks with different needs.

## Cons
- **Starvation Risk**: Low-priority queues may wait a long time if higher-priority queues are always busy.
- **Complexity**: Setting up and managing multiple queues requires more effort.
- **Inflexibility**: Once a process is assigned to a queue, itâ€™s hard to move it to another queue.
