# Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **How it Works**: The process with the shortest expected execution time is run next. The OS estimates how long each process will take.
- **Example**: A printer prints the shortest document (e.g., a 1-page letter) before a 50-page report.
- **Pros**:
  - Reduces average waiting time for processes.
  - Good for systems with predictable task lengths.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires knowing the execution time in advance, which isnâ€™t always possible.
  - Longer processes may starve (wait indefinitely).
