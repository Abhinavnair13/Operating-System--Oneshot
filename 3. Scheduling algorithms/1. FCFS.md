# CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## What is CPU Scheduling?
CPU scheduling is the process by which the operating system (OS) decides which process gets to use the CPU and when. The OS uses scheduling algorithms to manage this and ensure efficient multitasking.

## Common CPU Scheduling Algorithms

### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- **How it Works**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive. The first process in the queue gets the CPU first.
- **Example**: Imagine a bank teller serving customers. The first person in line gets served before the next.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple to implement and understand.
  - No complex calculations needed.
- **Cons**:
  - Can lead to long waiting times if a long process arrives first (called convoy effect).
  - Not efficient for short tasks.
