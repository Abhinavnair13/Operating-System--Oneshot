# Priority Scheduling
- **How it Works**: Processes are assigned a priority, and the CPU runs the highest-priority process first. Lower-priority processes wait.
- **Example**: In a hospital, a critical patient (high priority) is treated before a routine check-up.
- **Pros**:
  - Important tasks can be handled quickly.
  - Flexible for systems with varying task importance.
- **Cons**:
  - Low-priority processes can starve if high-priority ones keep arriving.
  - Requires a good priority assignment system.
