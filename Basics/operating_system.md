# Operating System (OS)

## What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and users. It manages hardware resources and provides essential services for computer programs.

### Key Functions of an OS:
1. **Process Management** – Handles execution of processes, scheduling, and multitasking.
2. **Memory Management** – Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.
3. **File System Management** – Organizes and manages files and directories.
4. **Device Management** – Controls peripheral devices like printers, keyboards, and storage.
5. **Security & Access Control** – Ensures data protection through authentication and authorization.
6. **User Interface (UI)** – Provides a graphical (GUI) or command-line (CLI) interface for users.

### Real-World Example:
Think of an OS as a **restaurant manager**:
- The **kitchen (hardware)** prepares food (performs tasks).
- The **manager (OS)** assigns orders to chefs (processes).
- The **waiters (UI)** take orders from customers (users).
- The **inventory system (memory management)** ensures ingredients are available.
- The **security guard (OS security)** prevents unauthorized entry.
