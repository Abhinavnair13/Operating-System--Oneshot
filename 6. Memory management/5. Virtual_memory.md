# Virtual Memory

## What is Virtual Memory?
Virtual memory is a **memory management technique** that allows a computer to use **disk space** as if it were **RAM (main memory).** This enables systems to run programs that require more memory than is physically available by temporarily storing less-used data on disk and swapping it back into RAM when needed.

## Swap Space

- Swap space is a portion of a hard disk or SSD used as **virtual memory** when the system's RAM is full.
- It temporarily holds inactive memory pages, allowing the OS to free up RAM for active processes.
-   Swap space helps prevent system crashes due to memory shortages but is significantly slower than physical RAM.

---

## Why is Virtual Memory Needed?
- Allows running large applications even if RAM is limited.
- Improves multitasking by efficiently managing memory between multiple processes.
- Prevents system crashes by handling memory shortages dynamically.

## How Does Virtual Memory Work?

1. **Process Requests Data** â€“ A process accesses a **virtual address**, assuming all data is in RAM.
2. **Page Table Lookup** â€“ The OS checks the **page table** to see if the data is already in RAM.
3. **Page Hit or Page Fault**
   - If the **page is in RAM**, it is accessed normally (**Page Hit**).
   - If the **page is not in RAM**, a **Page Fault** occurs, and the OS loads it from disk (swap space).
4. **Swapping Mechanism** â€“ The OS **swaps out** less-used memory pages to disk and **loads the needed page** into RAM.

## Key Components of Virtual Memory

### 1. Page Table
- Maps **virtual addresses** to **physical addresses**.
- Used to track which pages are in RAM and which are on disk.

### 2. Page Fault
- Happens when a program accesses a **page not currently in RAM**.
- The OS then loads the missing page from disk.

### 3. Swap Space (Paging File)
- A section of the hard disk used as **temporary RAM**.
- When RAM is full, **least-used pages** are moved to swap space.

## Example of Virtual Memory in Action

Assume a system has **4 GB of RAM**, but a running program requires **6 GB of memory**.

**Without Virtual Memory:** The program crashes due to insufficient RAM.
**With Virtual Memory:** The OS moves less-used pages to disk, making space for active pages in RAM.
``` yaml
[ Virtual Memory Space ]
--------------------------------------------------
| Page 1 (RAM) | Page 2 (RAM) | Page 3 (Disk) |
--------------------------------------------------
                        ðŸ”„
Swaps Page 3 to RAM, Moves Page 1 to Disk**
                        ðŸ”„
--------------------------------------------------
| Page 1 (Disk) | Page 2 (RAM) | Page 3 (RAM) |
--------------------------------------------------
```

## Advantages of Virtual Memory
- Efficient RAM Usage â€“ Frees up RAM by storing inactive pages on disk.
- Enables Multitasking â€“ Multiple programs can run simultaneously.
- Provides Memory Isolation â€“ Each process gets its own virtual address space.

## Disadvantages of Virtual Memory
- **Slower Performance** â€“ Accessing disk is much slower than RAM.
- **High Disk Usage** â€“ Constant swapping may wear out SSDs over time.
- **Increased CPU Overhead** â€“ Managing memory mappings and swapping pages takes extra processing power.

## Why Not Use the Whole Hard Disk as Swap Space?

Using the entire hard disk as swap space is impractical due to:

1. **Slow Performance** â€“ Hard disks and SSDs are much slower than RAM, causing excessive delays.
2. **Increased Wear and Tear** â€“ SSDs have a limited number of write cycles, and continuous swapping shortens their lifespan.
3. **Thrashing** â€“ If too much swap space is used, the system spends more time swapping data than executing tasks, making it unresponsive.
4. **Storage Limitation** â€“ Allocating the whole disk to swap means no space for files, applications, or the OS.



## Can Swap Space Be Used for Storage?

- No, once a portion of the disk is allocated as swap space, it is **reserved for the OS** and cannot be used for storing files.

| Feature           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Virtual Memory** | Uses disk space as RAM when needed. |
| **Page Table** | Maps virtual pages to physical frames. |
| **Page Fault** | Occurs when data is not in RAM, triggering disk access. |
