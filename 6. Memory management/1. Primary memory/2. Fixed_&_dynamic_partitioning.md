# Fixed Partitioning and Dynamic Partitioning in Operating Systems

1. **Fixed Partitioning** – Memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions.
2. **Dynamic Partitioning** – Memory is allocated dynamically based on process requirements.

## 1. Fixed Partitioning
Fixed partitioning (also known as **static partitioning**) is a memory management technique where the **entire memory is divided into fixed-sized partitions at system startup**.

### **Characteristics:**
- The **size and number** of partitions are **predefined**.
- Each partition can hold **only one process**.
- If a process is smaller than the partition, the remaining space is wasted (**internal fragmentation**).
- If a process is larger than any partition, it **cannot be loaded**, leading to **process rejection**.

### **Advantages:**
-  Simple to implement and manage.
-  No overhead for partition resizing.
- Suitable for small-scale systems with a known number of processes.

### **Disadvantages:**
- **Internal Fragmentation** – Unused space within a partition is wasted if the process does not fully utilize it.
- **Limited Flexibility** – The system cannot adjust partition sizes dynamically.
- **Process Rejection** – If a process is too large for any partition, it cannot be loaded into memory.

## 2. Dynamic Partitioning
Dynamic partitioning (also known as **variable partitioning**) **allocates memory dynamically based on process size**.

### **Characteristics:**
- No fixed partitions; memory is **allocated as needed**.
- When a process arrives, it gets **exactly the amount of memory it requires**.
- When a process terminates, its allocated memory is freed and can be reused.
- Can lead to **external fragmentation** – free memory exists but is scattered in small, unusable blocks.

### **Advantages:**
**No Internal Fragmentation** – Memory is allocated based on process size, reducing waste.
**Efficient Memory Utilization** – Processes get exactly the memory they need.
**Can Accommodate Larger Processes** – Unlike fixed partitioning, processes are not rejected due to partition size.

### **Disadvantages:**
**External Fragmentation** – Free memory is broken into small, scattered chunks, making it hard to allocate for larger processes.
**Compaction Overhead** – To solve external fragmentation, **compaction** (moving processes in memory to form a contiguous block) may be required, which is costly.

## 4. Comparison of Fixed and Dynamic Partitioning

| Feature | Fixed Partitioning | Dynamic Partitioning |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Memory Division** | Fixed-sized partitions | Allocated dynamically based on process size |
| **Flexibility** | Inflexible – partitions cannot be resized | Flexible – memory is allocated based on need |
| **Internal Fragmentation** | High – unused space in partitions | None – memory allocated exactly as needed |
| **External Fragmentation** | None | Present – free memory can be fragmented |
| **Process Handling** | Large processes may be rejected if no partition is big enough | Large processes can be accommodated if enough memory is available |
| **Complexity** | Simple | More complex due to dynamic allocation and compaction |

---

## 5. Summary
- **Fixed Partitioning** is easy to implement but suffers from **internal fragmentation** and **lack of flexibility**.
- **Dynamic Partitioning** eliminates internal fragmentation but may cause **external fragmentation**, requiring **compaction** to optimize memory usage.
- **Modern OSs** typically use **dynamic memory allocation** with paging or segmentation to optimize memory management.
