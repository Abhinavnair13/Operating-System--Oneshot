# Thrashing

## Definition
Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time **swapping pages in and out of memory** than executing actual processes. It significantly degrades system performance due to excessive **page faults**.

## Causes
- **High degree of multiprogramming**: Too many processes in memory.
- **Insufficient RAM**: Frequent page replacements due to low available memory.
- **Improper page replacement algorithm**: Poor page selection leads to repeated faults.
- **High working set demand**: The system cannot keep required pages in memory.

## Effects
- Increased **CPU overhead** due to constant page replacements.
- Reduced **throughput**, as less time is spent executing processes.
- Longer response times and poor overall system performance.

## Prevention
- **Working Set Model**: Maintain an optimal set of pages in memory.
- **Page Fault Frequency (PFF)**: Adjust the number of active processes dynamically.
- **Increasing RAM**: Helps accommodate more pages in memory.
- **Using better page replacement algorithms**: Reduces unnecessary page swaps.
