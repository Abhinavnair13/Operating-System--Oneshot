# Segmentation

## Definition
- Segmentation is a **memory management technique** that divides the process address space into **variable-sized segments** based on logical divisions such as functions, arrays, or stacks. Unlike paging, segmentation preserves logical program structure.
- Segmentation is like **dividing a book into chapters**. Instead of treating memory as one big continuous block, it is **broken into logical sections** based on how the program works.

## Characteristics
- Each segment has a **base address** and a **limit**.
- Eliminates **internal fragmentation** but may cause **external fragmentation**.
- Uses a **segment table** to map logical segments to physical memory.

## How It Works?
Imagine a book:
- **Each chapter** is like a **segment** in memory.
- **Each chapter has a title** (code, data, stack, etc.).
- **Each chapter has different lengths**, just like segments have **variable sizes**.

## Why Use Segmentation?
1. **Better organization** – Groups related data together.
2. **No fixed size** – Unlike pages, segments can grow based on needs.
3. **Faster access** – Since related data stays together, the CPU accesses it efficiently.

# Segmentation and Paging to Reduce Page Faults

## Concept
Combining **segmentation and paging** helps **optimize memory utilization** and **reduce page faults** by efficiently handling logical memory structures and physical memory allocation.

### **1. Segmentation with Paging**
- **Logical division** (segmentation) prevents **overhead from fixed page sizes**.
- **Each segment is divided into fixed-size pages**, reducing **external fragmentation**.
- **Page faults are minimized** as only required pages within segments are loaded.

### **2. Benefits of Segmentation and Paging**
- **Better memory utilization**: Reduces internal and external fragmentation.
- **Efficient page replacements**: Only specific **pages within a segment** are swapped instead of entire segments.
- **Less page faults**: By keeping frequently accessed segments in memory and swapping **only necessary pages**.

## Conclusion
By combining **segmentation and paging**, modern systems optimize memory allocation, reducing **page faults** while maintaining a logical program structure.
