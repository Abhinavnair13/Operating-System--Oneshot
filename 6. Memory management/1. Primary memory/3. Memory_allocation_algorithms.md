# Memory Allocation Algorithms: First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit

## Introduction
Memory allocation is a crucial aspect of an operating system's **memory management**. When a process requests memory, the OS must decide **where to place it** in the available free memory blocks.

Three common **memory allocation algorithms** used to place processes in memory are:

1. **First-Fit** – Allocates the first available block that is large enough.
2. **Best-Fit** – Allocates the smallest suitable block to minimize wasted space.
3. **Worst-Fit** – Allocates the largest available block to maximize remaining free memory.

## 1. First-Fit Allocation
### **Description:**
- Scans the **free memory list** from the beginning and **allocates the first block** that is **large enough**.
- Stops searching as soon as a suitable block is found.

### **Example:**
Available memory blocks: **[100MB, 500MB, 200MB, 300MB]**
Process request: **180MB**
- The **200MB block** is the first suitable block, so the process is placed there.

### **Advantages:**
- **Fastest allocation** – Stops searching once a suitable block is found.
- **Efficient for large processes** that need quick allocation.

### **Disadvantages:**
- **Can cause external fragmentation** since unallocated memory remains in scattered small blocks.
- **May leave larger blocks unused later**, reducing flexibility.

## 2. Best-Fit Allocation
### **Description:**
- Scans the entire free memory list and **chooses the smallest block** that can accommodate the process.
- Leaves the **least amount of leftover space**, reducing internal fragmentation.

### **Example:**
Available memory blocks: **[100MB, 500MB, 200MB, 300MB]**
Process request: **180MB**
- The **200MB block** is the **smallest suitable block**, so the process is placed there.

### **Advantages:**
- **Minimizes internal fragmentation** by selecting the best-sized block.
- **Efficient memory utilization** when dealing with small processes.

### **Disadvantages:**
- **Slower than first-fit** because it scans the entire list.
- **May cause external fragmentation** due to many small leftover gaps.

## 3. Worst-Fit Allocation
### **Description:**
- Scans the entire free memory list and **chooses the largest available block** to allocate memory.
- Leaves the **largest leftover space**, potentially useful for future allocations.

### **Example:**
Available memory blocks: **[100MB, 500MB, 200MB, 300MB]**
Process request: **180MB**
- The **500MB block** is the largest, so the process is placed there, leaving **320MB free**.

### **Advantages:**
- **Reduces external fragmentation** by keeping larger free blocks available.
- **Better suited for systems with varying process sizes**.

### **Disadvantages:**
- **Leads to inefficient memory usage**, as large blocks get broken into smaller unusable fragments.
- **Not optimal for small processes**, as large memory blocks may be unnecessarily divided.

## 5. Comparison of First-Fit, Best-Fit, and Worst-Fit

| Feature | First-Fit | Best-Fit | Worst-Fit |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Allocation Strategy** | Allocates the first available block that fits | Allocates the smallest suitable block | Allocates the largest available block |
| **Speed** | Fastest | Slower than First-Fit | Slowest |
| **Fragmentation Type** | Causes external fragmentation | Can cause both internal and external fragmentation | Can lead to external fragmentation |
| **Memory Utilization** | Moderate | Best for small processes | Poor, as large blocks break into smaller ones |
| **Suitability** | General-purpose systems | Systems with frequent small allocations | Systems where large memory blocks are preferred |

---

## 6. Summary
- **First-Fit** is **fast** and works well for general use but may lead to external fragmentation.
- **Best-Fit** minimizes **internal fragmentation** but may leave **small unusable memory blocks**.
- **Worst-Fit** keeps **large blocks available** but is inefficient for small processes.
