# Belady's Anomaly

Belady’s Anomaly is a phenomenon in **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) page replacement** where increasing the number of page frames **unexpectedly increases** the number of **page faults** instead of decreasing them.

## **Why Does Belady’s Anomaly Occur?**
- In FIFO, pages are replaced **strictly based on arrival order**, without considering future use.
- Sometimes, adding more frames **does not help** because FIFO may still evict frequently used pages.
- This leads to **more page faults**, contrary to the expectation that more frames should always improve performance.

## **Example**

Consider a system with the following **page reference string**:
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
### With **3 frames** :
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 5  | 5  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|    | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 5  | 3  | 3  |
|    |    | 3  | 4  | 1  | 2  | 5  | 5  | 5  | 3  | 4  | 4  |
|  | M | M | M | M | M | M | H  | H  | M | M | H  |

- M = Miss
- H = Hit
- Total page faults : **9**

### With **4 frames** :
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 1  | 2  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|   | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|   |   | 3  | 3  | 3 | 3  | 4  | 5  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|  |   |  | 4  | 4  | 4  | 5  | 1  | 2  | 3  |   4 |  5  |
| M | M | M | H  | H  | M | M | M | M | M | M | M |
- M = Miss
- H = Hit
- Total page faults : **10**
## **Key Observation**
- **More page frames (4) resulted in **more** page faults (10) than fewer frames (3), which had only 9 faults.**
- This contradicts the expectation that increasing memory should **always** improve performance.
- **Belady's Anomaly occurs only in FIFO**, but not in **LRU or Optimal Page Replacement**.

---
## **Conclusion**
Belady's Anomaly **proves that FIFO is not always efficient** and that increasing memory does not guarantee better performance. More advanced algorithms like **LRU (Least Recently Used)** avoid this problem by considering actual page usage patterns.
