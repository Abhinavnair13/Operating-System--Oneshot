# Page Replacement Algorithms

Page replacement algorithms decide which memory pages to **evict** when a new page needs to be loaded into RAM and there is no free space available. These algorithms help optimize system performance by reducing **page faults**.

---

## 1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- The **oldest** page in memory is replaced first.
- Uses a **queue** to track page order.
- **Simple but inefficient** as it may evict frequently used pages.

**Example:**
![fifo image](https://afteracademy.com/images/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms-fifo-bbf705290d1e6776.jpg)

**Total Page Faults:** 9
- Initially, all 4 slots are empty, so when 1, 2, 3, 4 came they are allocated to the empty slots in order of their arrival. This is page fault as 1, 2, 3, 4 are not available in memory.
- When 5 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces the oldest page in memory, i.e., 1.

- When 1 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces the oldest page in memory, i.e., 2.

- When 3,1 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.

- When 6 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces the oldest page in memory, i.e., 3.

- When 3 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces the oldest page in memory, i.e., 4.

- When 2 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces the oldest page in memory, i.e., 5.

- When 3 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.


### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Simple to implement | May replace frequently used pages |
| Easy to track using a queue | Can cause high page fault rates |
| Requires no complex calculations | Ignores page usage patterns |

## 2. Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Replaces the **least recently accessed** page.
- More efficient than FIFO as it considers usage history.
- Requires **extra overhead** to track usage.

**Example:**

**Total Page Faults:** 8
- Initially, all 4 slots are empty, so when 1, 2, 3, 4 came they are allocated to the empty slots in order of their arrival. This is page fault as 1, 2, 3, 4 are not available in memory.

- When 5 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 1 which is the least recently used page.

- When 1 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 2.

- When 3,1 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.

- When 6 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 4.

- When 3 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.

- When 2 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 5.

- When 3 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.

### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| More efficient than FIFO | Requires extra overhead to track page usage |
| Reduces unnecessary page faults | Slower than FIFO due to tracking mechanisms |
| Works well in real-world applications | May still cause faults in specific access patterns |

## 3. Optimal Page Replacement (OPT)
- Replaces the page that **will not be used for the longest time** in the future.
- Provides the **lowest** page fault rate but requires **future knowledge**, making it impractical in real systems.
- **Theoretical concept** often used as a benchmark.

**Example:**
![optimal img](https://afteracademy.com/images/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms-optimal-8e02fc8a1f4517de.jpg)

**Total Page Faults:** 6
- Initially, all 4 slots are empty, so when 1, 2, 3, 4 came they are allocated to the empty slots in order of their arrival. This is page fault as 1, 2, 3, 4 are not available in memory.

- When 5 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 4 which is going to be used farthest in the future among 1, 2, 3, 4.

- When 1,3,1 comes, they are available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.

- When 6 comes, it is not available in memory so page fault occurs and it replaces 1.

- When 3, 2, 3 comes, it is available in the memory, i.e., Page Hit, so no replacement occurs.
### Pros and Cons
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Provides the **lowest** page fault rate | Requires future knowledge, which is impossible in real systems |
| Used as a benchmark for other algorithms | Cannot be implemented practically |
| Helps analyze efficiency of practical algorithms | Requires additional computations |
