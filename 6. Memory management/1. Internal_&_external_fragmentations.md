# Internal and External Fragmentation in Operating Systems

## Introduction
Memory fragmentation is a common issue in **memory management** where free memory is wasted due to inefficient allocation. It occurs in two forms:

1. **Internal Fragmentation** – Wasted space inside allocated memory blocks.
2. **External Fragmentation** – Wasted space outside allocated memory blocks due to fragmentation.

## 1. Internal Fragmentation
Internal fragmentation occurs when a **memory block allocated to a process is larger than required**, leaving unused space **inside** the allocated block.

### **Causes:**
- Fixed-sized memory allocation (e.g., **Fixed Partitioning, Paging**).
- Processes rarely fit **perfectly** into allocated blocks, leaving small **unused gaps**.
- The OS often allocates memory in **fixed-size units** (e.g., 4KB pages), leading to waste when processes do not fully utilize them.

### **Example:**
- Assume a system with **fixed partitions of 8MB**.
- A process requests **6MB**, but since no **6MB partition exists**, it gets **8MB**.
- **2MB** remains unused inside the allocated partition (**internal fragmentation**).

### **Solutions:**
✅ **Dynamic Partitioning** – Allocates only the memory required for a process.
✅ **Paging with Smaller Page Sizes** – Reduces wasted space by using smaller memory units.
✅ **Slab Allocation** – Efficiently manages small memory requests by grouping objects of similar sizes.

## 2. External Fragmentation
External fragmentation occurs when **free memory is scattered in small, non-contiguous blocks**, making it **impossible to allocate memory to large processes**.

### **Causes:**
- **Dynamic partitioning** where processes frequently allocate and free memory.
- As processes terminate, **holes (free memory blocks) of varying sizes** form.
- Even if total free memory is sufficient, a **large process may not find a single contiguous block**.

### **Example:**
- Assume a **100MB memory system**.
- Three processes are allocated **20MB, 30MB, and 10MB**, leaving **40MB** free.
- The **30MB** process terminates, leaving a **30MB hole**.
- If a new **35MB process** arrives, **it cannot be allocated** despite **40MB total free memory**, because **no single contiguous 35MB block exists** (**external fragmentation**).

### **Solutions:**
✅ **Compaction** – Rearranges processes in memory to create a single large free block.
✅ **Paging & Segmentation** – Breaks memory into fixed-size pages or variable-size segments to avoid fragmentation.
✅ **Best-Fit Allocation** – Allocates memory in the smallest available block to minimize leftover space.

## 4. Comparison of Internal and External Fragmentation

| Feature | Internal Fragmentation | External Fragmentation |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Unused memory **inside** an allocated block | Unused memory **outside** allocated blocks, scattered across memory |
| **Cause** | Fixed-size memory allocation (e.g., partitions, paging) | Dynamic allocation leading to scattered free memory |
| **Example** | Allocating an 8MB block to a 6MB process (2MB wasted inside) | Free memory blocks of 30MB and 10MB, but a 35MB process cannot be allocated |
| **Solution** | Dynamic partitioning, paging with smaller sizes, slab allocation | Compaction, paging & segmentation, best-fit allocation |
