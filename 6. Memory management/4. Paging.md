# Paging in Operating Systems

## Introduction
Paging is a **memory management scheme** used by operating systems to efficiently allocate and manage memory. It eliminates **external fragmentation** by dividing memory into fixed-sized blocks and allows for **non-contiguous memory allocation**.

---

## What is Paging?
Paging divides:
- **Logical (virtual) memory** into fixed-size **pages**.
- **Physical memory (RAM)** into **frames** of the same size.

A **page table** is used to map **virtual pages** to **physical frames**, ensuring efficient memory access.

---

## How Paging Works
1. A process is divided into **fixed-size pages** (e.g., 4KB each).
2. Physical memory is divided into **fixed-size frames** (same size as pages).
3. The OS maintains a **page table** that maps **each virtual page** to a **physical frame**.
4. When a process accesses memory, the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** translates the virtual address into a physical address using the page table.

---

## Address Translation in Paging
A virtual address consists of:
- **Page Number (PN)** – Identifies the page within the process's address space.
- **Page Offset (PO)** – Specifies the exact location within the page.

### **Formula for Address Translation:**
```yaml
Physical Address = Frame Number × Page Size + Offset
```

- The **page number** is used to look up the **frame number** in the page table.
- The **offset** is added to the frame's base address to get the final physical address.

### Example: Address Translation in Paging

Let’s say we have:

- **Page size** = 4 KB (4096 bytes)
- **Virtual address** = 8196 (decimal)

We need to translate this virtual address into a **physical address**.

---

#### **1. Page Number Calculation**
Since each page is **4 KB (4096 bytes)**, memory addresses are divided as:
- **Page 0** → 0 to 4095
- **Page 1** → 4096 to 8191
- **Page 2** → 8192 to 12287
- _(and so on...)_

To find the **Page Number (PN)**:
\[
8196 \div 4096 = 2
\]
So, the address belongs to **Page 2**.

---

#### **2. Page Offset Calculation**
The **offset** tells us how far within the page this address is.

To find the **Page Offset (PO)**:
\[
8196 \mod 4096 = 4
\]
So, the **Offset = 4** (4th byte within Page 2).

---

#### **3. Final Interpretation**
- The requested memory is **inside Page 2**, at **Offset 4**.
- The **page table** maps **Page 2** to a **physical frame** in memory.
- The OS finds where **Page 2 is stored** in physical memory, then **adds the offset** to determine the **final physical address**.

---

## 5. Types of Paging

### **1. Simple Paging**
- Each process has one page table that directly maps virtual pages to physical frames.
- Used in smaller systems with limited memory.

### **2. Multi-level Paging**
- Instead of using one large page table, we break it into multiple levels to reduce memory usage.

- Reduces page table size but adds lookup overhead.

### **3. Inverted Paging**
- Uses a **single global page table** for all processes, reducing memory usage for page tables.
- Each entry contains the **process ID and virtual page number**.
- Instead of keeping multiple page tables, we store everything in one table and look it up when needed.

## 6. Advantages of Paging
✅ **Eliminates external fragmentation** as pages and frames are of fixed size.
✅ **Efficient memory utilization** by allowing non-contiguous allocation.
✅ **Supports virtual memory**, allowing processes to use more memory than physically available.
✅ **Faster memory allocation** compared to segmentation.

---

## 7. Disadvantages of Paging
❌ **Internal fragmentation** may occur if the process does not fully use the last page.
❌ **Page table overhead** as large address spaces require **large page tables**.
❌ **Translation overhead** since every memory access requires an extra page table lookup.
❌ **TLB misses** (Translation Lookaside Buffer) can slow down address translation.

## 8. Paging vs. Segmentation

| Feature | Paging | Segmentation |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Memory Division** | Fixed-size pages | Variable-size segments |
| **Fragmentation** | Internal fragmentation | External fragmentation |
| **Address Mapping** | Uses a **page table** | Uses a **segment table** |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed-size allocation | Allocates based on process structure |
| **Performance** | Fast but requires extra address translation | More flexible, but slower due to complex management |

---

## 9. Summary
- **Paging** divides memory into **fixed-size pages** mapped to **physical frames**, eliminating external fragmentation.
- The **page table** stores mappings of virtual pages to physical frames.
- **Multi-level paging and TLB caching** improve performance but introduce **lookup overhead**.
- **Paging is widely used in modern OS** because of its efficiency in **memory allocation and virtual memory support**.
