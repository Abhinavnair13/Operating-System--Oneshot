# **Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which disk I/O requests are processed to optimize seek time, latency, and overall efficiency. Below are some common disk scheduling algorithms:

---

## 1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Description**: Requests are processed in the order they arrive in the queue.
- **Pros**:
  - Simple and easy to implement.
  - Fair to all requests.
- **Cons**:
  - Can cause long delays if a request at the beginning of the queue is far from the current head position.
  - High average seek time.

### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608201201/fcfs3.jpg)
- Suppose the order of request is- (82,170,43,140,24,16,190)
And current position of Read/Write head is: 50
- So, total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) =
(82-50)+(170-82)+(170-43)+(140-43)+(140-24)+(24-16)+(190-16) =642

---

## 2. **Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
- **Description**: Selects the request that requires the least seek time from the current head position.
- **Pros**:
  - Reduces total seek time compared to FCFS.
  - More efficient in terms of access speed.
- **Cons**:
  - May cause **starvation** for requests that are far from frequently accessed tracks.
  - Can lead to unfair request servicing.
### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608201702/sstf1.jpg)
- Suppose the order of request is- (82,170,43,140,24,16,190)
And current position of Read/Write head is: 50

- So,
total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) =
(50-43)+(43-24)+(24-16)+(82-16)+(140-82)+(170-140)+(190-170) =208

---
## 3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**
- **Description**: The disk arm moves in one direction, servicing all requests along the way until it reaches the end, then reverses direction.
- **Pros**:
  - Provides better performance than FCFS and SSTF.
  - More efficient than SSTF as it avoids starvation.
- **Cons**:
- High response time for requests just missed during the scan.

### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202008/scan4.jpg)
-  the total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm)  is calculated as
= (199-50) + (199-16) = 332
---

## 4. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**
- **Description**: Similar to SCAN, but after reaching the end, the head returns to the beginning without servicing requests during the return.
- **Pros**:
  - Ensures uniform wait times for all requests.
  - Reduces the waiting time variance compared to SCAN.
- **Cons**:
  - May increase seek time due to the full return movement.
### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202230/cscan1.jpg)
- Suppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move “towards the larger value”.

- So, the total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as
- =(199-50) + (199-0) + (43-0) = 391


---

## 5. **LOOK**
- **Description**: A variation of SCAN where the head moves only as far as the last request in a given direction before reversing.
- **Pros**:
  - Reduces unnecessary head movement compared to SCAN.
  - Provides faster response time.
- **Cons**:
  - May still cause longer wait times for some requests.
### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202613/look1.jpg)
Suppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190. And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move “towards the larger value”.

So, the total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as:

- = (190-50) + (190-16) = 314
---

## 6. **C-LOOK (Circular LOOK)**
- **Description**: A variation of C-SCAN where the head moves only as far as the last request before returning to the beginning.
- **Pros**:
  - More efficient than C-SCAN.
  - Reduces unnecessary head movement.
- **Cons**:
  - May increase the average seek time due to the return movement.
### Example :
![alter img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200608202846/clook1.jpg)
- the total overhead movement  (total distance covered by the disk arm) is calculated as

= (190-50) + (190-16) + (43-16) = 341

These disk scheduling algorithms help improve **seek time efficiency**, **response time**, and **fairness** in managing disk I/O operations. The choice of the best algorithm depends on system workload and requirements.
