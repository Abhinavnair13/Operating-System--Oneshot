# Disk Management

Disk management refers to the **organization, allocation, and optimization** of storage space on a disk. It involves processes like partitioning, formatting, and handling file systems to ensure efficient data access and retrieval.

## **How is Data Stored on a Hard Disk?**
A **hard disk drive (HDD)** consists of **spinning platters** with magnetic surfaces that store data in concentric circles called **tracks**. These tracks are further divided into **sectors**. A **read/write head** moves over the platters to access data.


## Seek Time
**Seek time** is the time taken by the **read/write head** of a hard disk to move to the correct track where the required data is stored.
- Measured in **milliseconds (ms)**.
- Lower seek time means **faster disk performance**.
- **Average seek time** for modern HDDs is around **3-10ms**.

## Rotational Latency
**Rotational latency** is the **delay** before the required sector of the disk **rotates under the read/write head**.
- Depends on the **RPM (Revolutions Per Minute)** of the disk.

- Example: For a **7200 RPM** disk, rotational latency is 4.17ms

### Summary
- **Seek time**: Time to move the head to the correct track.
- **Rotational latency**: Time for the disk to spin and align the sector under the read/write head.
- Both factors impact **disk read/write performance**.
